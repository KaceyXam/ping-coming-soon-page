## Day 6 - Solid JS

Today I did the last newbie [Frontend Mentor]() project that has JavaScript. The JavaScript needed was very simple, you just needed to prevent default functions on the form. You also needed to check if the email input is a real email. Fortunatly, modern browsers won't let you submit an email input without it being a valid email.

### What is Solid Js

[Solid JS]() is a modern JavaScript framework similar to [React](). The syntax is very similar to React but unlike React, there is no Virtual DOM. Solid is also very fast, blazingly fast even.

### Solid JS vs React

I would say, for right now, React is still better than Solid, since the community for Solid is way smaller than React's. In the future though, I could see Solid being the clear choice for fast websites.

### Will I use Solid Again

I will probably focus more on React than Solid for now, but when Solid gets a bigger community, I will be using it much more often.
